<h2 align="center">Inspiration:</h2>

  <p>Having successfully completed School of Codes’ 16-week intensive bootcamp, it was finally time to build my portfolio website. Delving into research and design concepts, I opted for a sleek, uncluttered layout with excellent contrast. A pivotal priority was ensuring the site's responsiveness, guaranteeing an optimal user experience across all devices.
</p>

<br>

<h2 align="center">How I built it:</h2>

  <p>I chose to use Next.js, a React-Based Framework, capitalising on my additional experience with React and using the opportunity to gain additional experience with Next.js. It also meant I was still able to use React components, it offered better search engine optimization, plus the documentation and resources available are great. 
    
Upon researching Tailwind CSS and recognising its suitability for responsive design, a crucial element of my project, I decided to learn it on the go and integrate it for the first time.

For deployment, I opted for Vercel. Knowing of its affiliation with the Next.js team and that the process is very seamless due to this.
</p>

<br>

<h2 align="center">Challenges:</h2>

  <p>The project progressed pretty smoothly without major challenges, the primary hurdle arose during the adoption of Tailwind CSS. Becoming familiar with its syntax and nuances, while aiming to guarantee an optimal user experience across all devices.
</p>

<br>

<h2 align="center">Accomplishments:</h2>

  <p>Overall, I’m really happy with the project and confident that it has successfully met its objectives. A fully responsive portfolio app with a clean UI, allowing me to easily share my work and a bit about me. It was particularly fun learning Tailwind CSS, a super tool for responsive design that I look forward to using again.
</p>

<br>

<h2 align="center">What I learnt:</h2>

  <p>The project served as a fantastic learning experience. I gained proficiency in Next.js and Tailwind CSS, expanding and improving my technical skill set. A key takeaway for future projects involving Tailwind CSS is to build the site in mobile view first and then progress through larger screen sizes. This approach would prevent occasional instances of working backward after making tweaks, aligning more efficiently with the design principles of Tailwind CSS.
</p>

<br>

<h2 align="center">What's next for My Portfolio:</h2>

  <p>Looking ahead, I’m planning to work on adding some content to the page, mainly in the form of additional projects. I’ll also be gathering some user feedback, exploring opportunities to enhance and refine the site further.
